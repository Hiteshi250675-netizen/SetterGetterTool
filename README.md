# SetterGetterTool
SetterGetterGenerator is a runtime code generation utility that uses the Reflection API of Java Programming Language to automatically generate a default constructor, setter method and getter method. Instead of manually writing boilerplate code, this tool generates it dynamically and copies it directly to the system clipboard.
